This is a Virtual assistance (AI) created by me and it's name is ATP. This is made in Python 3.7 so if anyone is using or customising this
codes the he/she must use their supported files. This is virtual assistance made by the idea of Jarvis of iron man and you need internet
connection for operation.
Feel free to use and customise this and share with your friends.

The main file is jarvis.py and other files are not necessary if your device already have python modules so you can only download jarvis.py 
only then run on command promt.

Note: You Must edit your application path inorder to open them with command.
